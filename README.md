# calc - A text-mode RPN calculator

NOTE: Since "calc" is a very common name, I'm considering changing the
name of this program, probably to "calq".  (The 'q' has no intended
meaning beyond making the spelling reasonably unique.)

`calc` is implemented in Perl.  It maintains an unbounded stack of
values and supports various operations on those values.

Run `calc -man` or `calc man`, or `man calc` (if the man page is
installed), or the `man` command from within calc, to see the manual.
If you're viewing this on GitHub, see `calc.1.md`.

Documentation files `calc.1` and `calc.1.md` are automatically
generated from `calc` (see `Makefile`), but are included in the
git repo.

`calc` uses the experimental `signatures` feature, introduced in
Perl 5.20.  The included `nosig` script, invoked via `make nosig`,
creates a version of `calc` that does not use signatures, for use on
systems with older versions of Perl.

You might need to adjust the `#!/usr/bin/perl` line for your system.

`make` with no arguments creates the documentation files and `calc_nosig`.
